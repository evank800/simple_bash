# simple_bash
This is a very simple bash script using tcpdump to capture network traffics on a given network interface and using the ip addresses captured to display the geo-location of those using the API from IP-API. This is my very first bash script in order to familiarize myself with different linux commands and the process of automization in the context of linux.
